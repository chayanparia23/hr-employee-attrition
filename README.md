The **software company** is facing issues with respect to leaving employee. Lately they lost many talented employee and company HR faced issues with retaining them. To overcome the issues of employee retention, company has decided to explore innovative ways, so that they can retain their productive and talented resources.

To resolve their issues, I have worked upon the root cause and predict the future implications with respect to employee stay in the company or leave the company? For that company has provided history of the permanent employee data with department information.

The data was sources from the HRMS where the details of the past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
